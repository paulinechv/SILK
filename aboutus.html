						<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
						<p> SILK was created in 2020 by four students: <a id="Emma" class="student" href="https://emma-deladure.github.io/my-profile/" target="_blank">Emma</a>, <a id="PaulineB" class="student" href="#" target="_blank">Pauline</a>, <a id="PaulineC" class="student" href="#" target="_blank">Pauline</a> and <a id="Ruben" class="student" href="https://rubenhssd.github.io/hey/" target="_blank">Ruben</a> who were eager to make the cosmetic world evolve by respecting the envrionment.</p>
						<p> SILK ("soie" in french) is the softest natural plant that the Earth has given us. It reminds us of our two sources of inspiration: a <span>French know-how</span>, while respecting the softness of natural products in the most primary states possible.</p>
						<p> Using our products means respecting our planet while wrapping your face in silk.</p>
